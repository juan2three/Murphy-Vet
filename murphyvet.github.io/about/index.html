				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>Founded in 1986, Murphy Veterinary Clinic  specializes in providing dogs and cats with medical care, boarding and baths. Murphy Veterinary Clinic understands the need for consistent care. We treat each patient like family. Our compassionate, professional staff is dedicated to providing the highest level of care possible. Because we are physician owned, we are patient driven and focus on providing excellent care. We provide effective care that is responsive to the needs of the community of Central Florida. Being physician owned means that we are able to focus on you.</p>

				<p>Although we do offer same-day appointments when available, we encourage making appointments. Our friendly staff will be happy to answer any questions you have regarding scheduling and payment arrangements.</p>
